ANTLR and JavaCC are both parser generators for Java, but they have different strengths and use cases. Hereâ€™s a comparison to help you decide which one suits your needs:

### **1. Syntax & Ease of Use**
- **ANTLR**: Uses a high-level, human-readable grammar syntax that separates lexer and parser rules. It is more beginner-friendly and has extensive documentation.
- **JavaCC**: Uses a more Java-like syntax that is closer to manually writing a recursive-descent parser. It can be harder to read and maintain.

### **2. Power & Features**
- **ANTLR**:
  - Supports **LL(*)** parsing (not just LL(1)), allowing for more expressive grammars.
  - Supports automatic **AST generation** and tree walking with tools like **ANTLR visitor and listener patterns**.
  - Comes with **built-in error handling** and recovery mechanisms.
- **JavaCC**:
  - Uses **LL(1) parsing**, which makes it less powerful for handling complex grammars.
  - Requires more manual work for AST generation and tree walking.
  - Error handling is more manual and requires additional effort.

### **3. Extensibility**
- **ANTLR**:
  - Supports multiple target languages (Java, C++, Python, JavaScript, etc.).
  - Has built-in support for semantic predicates and rewriting rules.
- **JavaCC**:
  - Primarily focused on Java.
  - Less flexibility in supporting different language targets.

### **4. Tooling & Community**
- **ANTLR**:
  - Actively maintained with a large community.
  - Has an official IDE plugin (ANTLRWorks) for easier debugging.
- **JavaCC**:
  - Older and less actively maintained.
  - Lacks modern debugging tools.

### **5. Performance**
- **ANTLR**:
  - Generally performs well but can be slower than JavaCC for simple grammars due to its **LL(*) parsing**.
- **JavaCC**:
  - More efficient for **strict LL(1) grammars**, as it generates fast recursive-descent parsers.

### **6. Use Cases**
| Use Case | Best Choice |
|----------|------------|
| Complex grammars with multiple lookaheads | **ANTLR** |
| Need for an abstract syntax tree (AST) | **ANTLR** |
| Java-specific, simple LL(1) grammars | **JavaCC** |
| Performance-critical applications with simple grammars | **JavaCC** |
| Multi-language support | **ANTLR** |
| Built-in error handling | **ANTLR** |

### **Conclusion**
- If you need **flexibility, ease of use, and support for complex grammars**, **ANTLR is the better choice**.
- If you prefer **manual control, prioritize performance for LL(1) grammars, and want a lightweight solution**, **JavaCC may be sufficient**.

Since your JavaFX project involves **browser automation and launching browsers**, you may not need a parser generator. But if you need to **parse configurations, scripting languages, or commands**, **ANTLR** would be a better fit. Do you have a specific use case in mind?
